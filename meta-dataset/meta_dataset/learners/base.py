    Note that Gin configuration of subclasses of `Learner` will override any

    details).

      is_training: Whether the `Learner` is in training (as opposed to
        evaluation) mode.
      logit_dim: An integer; the maximum dimensionality of output predictions.
      transductive_batch_norm: Whether to batch-normalize in the transductive
        setting, where means and variances for normalization are computed from
        each of the support and query sets (rather than using the support set
        statistics for normalization of both the support and query set).
      backprop_through_moments: Whether to allow gradients to flow through the
        support set moments; only applies to non-transductive batch norm.
