    """Initialize a EpisodeDescriptionConfig.

    This is used in sampling.py in Trainer and in EpisodeDescriptionSampler to
    determine the parameters of episode creation relating to the ways and shots.

    Args:
      num_ways: Integer, fixes the number of classes ("ways") to be used in each
        episode. None leads to variable way.
      num_support: An integer, a tuple of two integers, or None. In the first
        case, the number of examples per class in the support set. In the
        second case, the range from which to sample the number of examples per
        class in the support set. Both of these cases would yield class-balanced
        episodes, i.e. all classes have the same number of support examples.
        Finally, if None, the number of support examples will vary both within
        each episode (introducing class imbalance) and across episodes.
      num_query: Integer, fixes the number of examples for each class in the
        query set.
      min_ways: Integer, the minimum value when sampling ways.
      max_ways_upper_bound: Integer, the maximum value when sampling ways. Note
        that the number of available classes acts as another upper bound.
      max_num_query: Integer, the maximum number of query examples per class.
      max_support_set_size: Integer, the maximum size for the support set.
      max_support_size_contrib_per_class: Integer, the maximum contribution for
        any given class to the support set size.
      min_log_weight: Float, the minimum log-weight to give to any particular
        class when determining the number of support examples per class.
      max_log_weight: Float, the maximum log-weight to give to any particular
        class.
      ignore_dag_ontology: Whether to ignore ImageNet's DAG ontology when
        sampling classes from it. This has no effect if ImageNet is not part of
        the benchmark.
      ignore_bilevel_ontology: Whether to ignore Omniglot's DAG ontology when
        sampling classes from it. This has no effect if Omniglot is not part of
        the benchmark.
      ignore_hierarchy_probability: Float, if using a hierarchy, this flag makes
        the sampler ignore the hierarchy for this proportion of episodes and
        instead sample categories uniformly.
      simclr_episode_fraction: Float, fraction of episodes that will be
        converted to SimCLR Episodes as described in the CrossTransformers
        paper.
      min_examples_in_class: An integer, the minimum number of examples that a
        class has to contain to be considered. All classes with fewer examples
        will be ignored. 0 means no classes are ignored, so having classes with
        no examples may trigger errors later. For variable shots, a value of 2
        makes it sure that there are at least one support and one query samples.
        For fixed shots, you could set it to `num_support + num_query`.
      num_unique_descriptions: An integer, the number of unique episode
        descriptions to use. If set to x > 0, x episode descriptions are
        pre-generated, and repeatedly iterated over. This is especially helpful
        when running on TPUs as it avoids the use of
        tf.data.Dataset.from_generator. If set to x = 0, no such upper bound on
        number of unique episode descriptions is set. Note that this is the
        number of unique episode descriptions _for each source dataset_,
        not total unique episode descriptions.
