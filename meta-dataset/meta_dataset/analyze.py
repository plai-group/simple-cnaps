r"""Script for aggregating the eval summaries into dicts.

This script assumes that the evaluation has already been ran (and has produced
the eval summaries from which this script reads).

Creates four dicts: One maps each observed 'shot' to a list of class precisions
obtained by classes that had that shot (regardless of shots of other classes in
the same episode). The second maps each observed 'way' of an episode to a list
of accuracies of the episodes with that way. The third maps each observed height
(of the lowest common ancestor of pairs of leaves corresponding to the Synsets
of ImageNet binary classification tasks from the training subgraph) to the
accuracy of those tasks, aiming to study how the fine- or coarse- grainedness of
a task affects its difficulty. The fourth maps each observed degree of imbalance
(w.r.t the numbers of shots of the different classes in the task) to the
accuracy of the corresponding episodes.
Summarized versions are also created that keep only the mean and confidence
intervals instead of the list of all precisons or accuracies, resp. as the
values of these dicts.
