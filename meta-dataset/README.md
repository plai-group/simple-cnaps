This repository contains accompanying code for the article introducing
Meta-Dataset, [arxiv.org/abs/1903.03096](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03096).
It also contains accompanying code and checkpoints for CrossTransformers,
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11498](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11498), a
follow-up work which improves performance.

This code is provided here in order to give more details on the implementation
of the data-providing pipeline, our back-bones and models, as well as the
experimental setting.

See below for [user instructions](#user-instructions), including how to:

1.  [install](#installation) the software,
2.  [download and convert](#downloading-and-converting-datasets) the data, and
3.  [train](#training) implemented models.

See this
[introduction notebook](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset/blob/main/Intro_to_Metadataset.ipynb)
for a demonstration of how to sample data from the pipeline (episodes or
batches).

In order to run the experiments described in the first version of the arXiv

We are currently working on updating the instructions, code, and configuration
files to reproduce the results in the second version of the article,

## Meta-Dataset: A Dataset of Datasets for Learning to Learn from Few Examples

Few-shot classification refers to learning a classifier for new classes given
only a few examples. While a plethora of models have emerged to tackle it, we
find the procedure and datasets that are used to assess their progress lacking.
To address this limitation, we propose Meta-Dataset: a new benchmark for
training and evaluating models that is large-scale, consists of diverse
datasets, and presents more realistic tasks. We experiment with popular
baselines and meta-learners on Meta-Dataset, along with a competitive method
that we propose. We analyze performance as a function of various characteristics
of test tasks and examine the models' ability to leverage diverse training
sources for improving their generalization. We also propose a new set of
baselines for quantifying the benefit of meta-learning in Meta-Dataset. Our
extensive experimentation has uncovered important research challenges and we
hope to inspire work in these directions.

## CrossTransformers: spatially-aware few-shot transfer

_Carl Doersch, Ankush Gupta, Andrew Zisserman_

This is a Transformer-based neural network architecture which can find coarse
spatial correspondence between the query and the support images, and then infer
class membership by computing distances between spatially-corresponding
features.  The paper also introduces SimCLR episodes, which are episodes that
require SimCLR-style instance recognition, and therefore encourage features
which capture more than just the training-set categories.  This algorithm is
SOTA on Meta-Dataset (train-on-ILSVRC) as of NeurIPS 2020.

Configuration files for CrossTransformers with and without SimCLR episodes (CTX
and CTX+SimCLR Eps from the paper) can be found in
`learn/gin/default/crosstransformer*`.  We also have pretrained checkpoints for
these two configurations:
[CTX](https://storage.googleapis.com/dm_crosstransformer/ctx.zip),
and
[CTX+SimCLR Eps](https://storage.googleapis.com/dm_crosstransformer/ctx_simclreps.zip),
as well as
[CTX+SimCLR Eps+BOHB Aug](https://storage.googleapis.com/dm_crosstransformer/ctx_simclreps_bohbaug.zip).
Note that these were retrained from the versions reported in the paper, but
their performance should be on-par.  The network structure is the same for all
three models, and so they can be loaded using either of the CrossTransformer
config files.

# Leaderboard (in progress)

The tables below were generated by
[this notebook](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset/blob/main/Leaderboard.ipynb).

## Adding a new model to the leaderboard

1.  Gather accuracy results and 95% confidence intervals, as well as the number
    of episodes used for the CI (minimum 600).
2.  If you were affected by
    [#54](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset/issues/54),
    make sure the evaluation on Traffic Sign is done on shuffled samples. We
    encourage you to re-train your best model (or at least perform validation
    again) as well.
3.  Create an
    [issue](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset/issues/new),
    with the name of the model, results, as well as the article to cite or any
    other relevant information to include, and label it "leaderboard".
    Alternatively, submit a PR with an update to the notebook.

# User instructions

## Installation

Meta-Dataset is generally compatible with Python 2 and Python 3, but some parts
of the code may require Python 3. The code works with TensorFlow 2, although it
makes extensive use of `tf.compat.v1` internally.

-   We recommend you follow
    [these instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) to install
    TensorFlow.
-   A list of packages to install is available in `requirements.txt`, you can
    install them using `pip`.
-   Clone the `meta-dataset` repository. Most command lines start with `python
    -m meta_dataset.<something>`, and should be typed from within that clone
    (where a `meta_dataset` Python module should be visible).
-   To reproduce the CrossTransformers training, you will need data augmentation
    code from [simclr](https://github.com/google-research/simclr), which is
    autimatically downloaded by `setup.py`.

## Downloading and converting datasets

Meta-Dataset uses several established datasets, that are available from
different sources. You can find below a summary of these datasets, as well as
instructions to download them and convert them into a common format.

For brevity of the command line examples, we assume the following environment
variables are defined:

-   `$DATASRC`: root of where the original data is downloaded and potentially
    extracted from compressed files. This directory does not need to be
    available after the data conversion is done.
-   `$SPLITS`: directory where `*_splits.json` files will be created, one per
    dataset. For instance, `$SPLITS/fungi_splits.json` contains information
    about which classes are part of the meta-training, meta-validation, and
    meta-test set. These files are only used during the dataset conversion
    phase, but can help troubleshooting later. To re-use the
    [canonical splits](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset/tree/main/meta_dataset/dataset_conversion/splits)
    instead of re-generating them, you can make it point to
    `meta_dataset/dataset_conversion` in your checkout.
-   `$RECORDS`: root directory that will contain the converted datasets (one per
    sub-directory). This directory needs to be available during training and
    evaluation.

## Training

Experiments are defined via [gin](google/gin-config) configuration files, that
are under `meta_dataset/learn/gin/`:

-   `setups/` contain generic setups for classes of experiment, for instance
    which datasets to use (`imagenet` or `all`), parameters for sampling the
    number of ways and shots of episodes.
-   `models/` define settings for different meta-learning algorithms (baselines,
    prototypical networks, MAML...)
-   `default/` contains files that each correspond to one experiment, mostly
    defining a setup and a model, with default values for training
    hyperparameters.
-   `best/` contains files with values for training hyperparameters that
    achieved the best performance during hyperparameter search.

There are three main architectures, also called "backbones" (or "embedding
networks"): `four_layer_convnet` (sometimes `convnet` for short), `resnet`, and
`wide_resnet`. These architectures can be used by all baselines and episodic
models. Another backbone, `relationnet_convnet` (similar to `four_layer_convnet`
but without pooling on the last layer), is only used by RelationNet (and
baseline, for pre-training purposes).  CrossTransformers use a larger backbone
`resnet34`, which is similar to `resnet` but with more layers.

### Reproducing results

See [Reproducing best results](doc/reproducing_best_results.md) for
instructions to launch training experiments with the values of hyperparameters
that were selected in the paper. The hyperparameters (including the backbone,
whether to train from scratch or from pre-trained weights, and the number of
training updates) were selected using only the validation classes of the ILSVRC
2012 dataset for all experiments. Even when training on "all" datasets, the
validation classes of the other datasets were not used.
