        Estimate a covariance matrix given data.

        Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
        If we examine N-dimensional samples, `X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
        then the covariance matrix element `C_{ij}` is the covariance of
        `x_i` and `x_j`. The element `C_{ii}` is the variance of `x_i`.

        Args:
            examples: A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
                Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
                observation of all those variables.
            rowvar: If `rowvar` is True, then each row represents a
                variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the
                relationship is transposed: each column represents a variable,
                while the rows contain observations.

            The covariance matrix of the variables.
